    <description>It's a lamp that looks like Discord, what else is there to say?\n\nIt doesn't provide much in the way of light, but it doesn't require any power and will continue operating during solar flares.\n\nThis one glows with a dim light. People who prefer to work in darklight are happy with this light source.</description>
