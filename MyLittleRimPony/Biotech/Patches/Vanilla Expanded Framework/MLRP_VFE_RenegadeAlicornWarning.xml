				<description>You are an alicorn, the most graceful of the pony races, but you're not like the others. Peace, friendship and harmony are meaningless; as far as you are concerned, the true path to greatness is paved with blood, bones and fear.\n\nYou managed to convince a few people to follow you and now, with nothing but their help, a large bag of silver, and the materials needed to convert it into things you'll need, you will find a way off this godforsaken rock. Once you manage that, you will travel the universe, teaching your lessons to those who will listen... and crushing those who don't.\n\nIMPORTANT: As a renegade alicorn, you will start out hostile towards the NPC Brony Community faction!</description>
