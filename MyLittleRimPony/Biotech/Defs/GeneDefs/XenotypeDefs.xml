    <description>This xenotype is one of five that was created by a group calling itself the 'Equestrian Integration Society.' Their goal was to create xenotypes based on the five pony races, but the end results turned out to be much different than they expected.\n\nAlicorns have exceptional artistic and social skills, but fare poorly at everything else. They are exceedingly beautiful, and can heal wounds or gain immunity to disease faster than other races, but are vulnerable to attack.\n\nThey can also increase their social skills by a substantial amount for a time, but only once per quadrum.\n\nThey get along fine with earth ponies, unicorns and pegasi, but they are not very fond of changelings.</description>

    <description>This xenotype is one of five that was created by a group calling itself the 'Equestrian Integration Society.' Their goal was to create xenotypes based on the five pony races, but the end results turned out to be much different than they expected.\n\nEarth ponies are sturdy beings who excel at working with nature, but aren't very good at more 'advanced' skills, such as crafting.\n\nThey also have quite large appetites, and will consume more food than the other pony races.\n\nThey get along fine with alicorns, unicorns and pegasi, but they are not very fond of changelings.</description>
    <descriptionShort>Earth ponies excel at working with plants and animals, but struggle with more intellectual skills. They can shrug off most blows, and will not slow down when attacked. However, they do tend to eat a lot.</descriptionShort>

    <description>This xenotype is one of five that was created by a group calling itself the 'Equestrian Integration Society.' Their goal was to create xenotypes based on the five pony races, but the end results turned out to be much different than they expected.\n\nChangelings are a race of insect-like equines who can change their form to that of any creature they like; they then use this ability to gather love, which they bring back to their hives and feed on.\n\nRim-based changelings lack the ability to shapeshift, but they make up for that with their skills in crafting and construction, though they are terrible at pretty much anything else. They are not very nice to look at, but they have high libidos, are very fertile, can eat pretty much anything, don't get cold easily, and thrive in polluted areas.\n\nA side effect of the xenogerm implementation process has given them the ability to shoot acid at their enemies, something they do with great zeal. Furthermore, they are scared of fire, and they don't get along with the other pony xenotypes.</description>
    <descriptionShort>Changelings excel at crafting and construction, but are bad at everything else. They can spray acid at their enemies, survive in cold areas with ease and have high libidos and fertility alongside robust digestive systems and the ability to thrive in polluted areas. They are afraid of fire, very ugly and don't get along with other pony kinds.</descriptionShort>
