* Nightmare Moon: Request deadlife dust. (1)
* Nightmare Moon: Request items required for dark research. (1, 2)
* Nightmare Moon: Request ghoul resurrection serum. (1, 3)
* Thingpone plushie: Reduces sanity loss.

1. This might have to be a very expensive recipe.
2. Lock behind other dark research so that it won't be too easy.
3. Lock behind regular research, requiring a hi-tech bench and a multi-analyser.

Alternatively, make Thingpone a new building and put all of this stuff there, making it so that you need dark research items to request stuff.

* Anomaly: Added Thingpone, the loveable eldritch horror who is ready and willing to grant you items in exchange for your hard-earned void research.
* Anomaly: Added two new recipes, accessible only at the Thingpone statue.
	* Request deadlife dust: <COST>
	* Request ghoul resurrection serum: <COST>
* Vanilla Achievements Expanded: Added achievement to build Thingpone.
