|      WHAT DOES THIS MOD DO?      |
|----------------------------------|

CORE

* Combatible with Combat Extended!
* Adds plush versions of a variety of ponies, each of which can be carried in the utility slot to confer bonuses depending on which pony it is. Also adds plushies related to the DLCs, if any of them are enabled. It also adds my OC to the core mod, because of *course* it does. :P
* Plushies can be made of cloth, or any other textile (including human leather).
* Colonists will actively seek out and equip plushies themselves, though you might need to force them to wear the one that actually suits them better (because a pawn with poor Plants skill may decide to equip an Applejack plush).
* Adds the Elements of Harmony, made using 1800 textiles. This item combines the bonuses given by all of the Mane Six plushies into one item.
* Adds a weapon which hurls Cadences at your enemy. This aptly named 'wife thrower' can be thrown twice as fast as a pila and only requires skill 3 Crafting and 75 wood to make.
* Adds the Orbital Friendship Cannon (OFC), an item only available through quests, traders, or very rarely at some faction settlements. It can be rearmed for 100 gold, allowing you to use it again.
* All items added by this mod, with the exception of the OFC, are made at a dedicated plushie bench.
* Adds the 'Brony' trait, which renders the pawn incapable of violence, but increases their Social skill by 6 and prevents mood loss from being insulted. Gets a +10 opinion bonus towards other pawns with the same trait and a +10 mood bonus as long as a plushie is equipped. They also get +20 to mood if they have a Harmony Chip implant (requires Royalty).
* Adds the 'Anti brony' trait; the pawn is capable of violence, gets a -10 opinion of pawns with the 'Brony' trait, and suffers -20 to mood if they are forced to carry any kind of pony plushie or if they have a Harmony Chip installed.
* Adds the 'Brony Community' scenario, which starts you with three pawns, each of whom has the Brony trait. You start with four ready to install steel mini-turrets, as well as the necessary research to build more.
* Adds the Rainbow Laser, a weapon that fires - you guessed it - rainbows.
* Adds the Discord Lamp, which is the same as a normal standing lamp, except it looks like Discord. Requires 300 cloth or leather to build, and isn't as bright as normal lights, but does not require any electricity. Also available in red, green and blue once coloured lights has been researched.
* Adds the Screwball generator, which is basically a pony that generates 300W of power.
* Adds an NPC version of the brony faction, which you can help, hinder or annihilate as you see fit.
* Adds a Sweetie Bot turret. 'nuff said.
* Adds the Cutie Mark Crusaders, made using 900 textiles. This item combines the bonuses given by all of the CMC plushies into one item.
* Adds a Statue of Nightmare Moon, which allows you to obtain exotic items - including luciferium - using chocolate (though it works out being a bit more expensive than buying them normally).
* Adds a Statue of Daybreaker, which allows you to convert one material into the market value equivalent of another. It also allows you to make batches of 5 or 10 regular or advanced components much quicker than a fabrication bench. Just make sure you've got plenty of chemfuel in stock.
* Adds Nurse Redheart, obtainable only via quests; she provides 5 Medicine every 10 days as long as she has 350W of power.
* Adds patches for various other mods (see below for details).
* Adds Mudbriar, Quibble Pants and Zephyr Breeze as turrets which do zero damage, and only serve to distract raiders.
* Adds poison joke, a drug which affects a pawns capacities, such as manipulation or breathing, in either a positive or negative way. Also adds an item, made using 10 neutroamine and 15 herbal medicine, which cures a person of an addiction to poison joke.
* Adds the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000, obtainable only via quests; it will provide 30 Beer every 30 days as long as it has 500W of power.
* Adds the Cutie Pox as a disease you can catch. It causes pain and requires a lot of tending, but increases a lot of skills by a small amount.

ROYALTY

* Adds the Harmony Chip, a brain implant which grants a pawn the bonuses of every plushie at once (except for Starlight Glimmer). Bonuses from Ideology and Biotech plushies are also applied (if those DLCs are enabled).

IDEOLOGY

* Adds two preconfigured ideologies: Disciples of Harmony and the Cult of Chaos.
* Adds the Harmony precept, which grants the same bonuses of all the Mane Six plushies, but at a smaller rate. Requires the 'Individualist' meme.

BIOTECH

* Adds a unicorn horn gene mod which improves a pawn's manipulation by 50% and their carrying capacity by 50kg.
* Adds an earth pony strength gene mod which imbues a pawn with extra hardiness, increasing their armour and cold/heat resistances.
* Adds a pegasus wings gene mod which makes a pawn faster (+2c/s move speed) and more agile (+15% extra dodge chance).
* All three of these effects can be applied at once using the alicorn gene mod.
* Sweetie Bot mechanoids!
