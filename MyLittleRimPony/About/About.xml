It has been thousands of years since <i>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</i> last aired, but the show is once again enjoying a resurgence; how it came to the rim, though, remains a mystery. Regardless of the hows and whys, many colonists have embraced the show, as the colourful characters and messages of peace, hope and friendship help them to escape the struggles of trying to survive daily life in their colonies.

Many of them have even taken to carrying pony plushies, with some people claiming that they feel as though the object is transferring some of the essence of that particular pony into them. While no scientific proof as been found of this, many people are accepting it as fact simply because it gives them something to be happy about. Consequently, pony plushies are now as much a part of everyday rim life as food and guns.

Some people have even gone so far as to undergo xenotype implementation in order to more closely resemble one of the many races that inhabit Equestria, though the results weren't exactly what they were expecting.
