	<description><![CDATA[<b>ABOUT</b>

It has been thousands of years since <i>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</i> last aired, but the show is once again enjoying a resurgence; how it came to the rim, though, remains a mystery. Regardless of the hows and whys, many colonists have embraced the show, as the colourful characters and messages of peace, hope and friendship help them to escape the struggles of trying to survive daily life in their colonies.

Many of them have even taken to carrying pony plushies, with some people claiming that they feel as though the object is transferring some of the essence of that particular pony into them. While no scientific proof as been found of this, many people are accepting it as fact because it gives them something to be happy about. Consequently, pony plushies are now as much a part of everyday rim life as food and guns.

<b>WHAT DOES THIS MOD DO?</b>

This mod adds plush versions of a variety of ponies, each of which can be carried in the utility slot to confer bonuses depending on which pony it is. It also adds my OC, because I <i>did</i> make the mod after all. :P

They are made at a dedicated plushie bench using 300 cloth and and have a market value of 200 silver. You can also combine one each of the Mane Six, plus some gold, into the Elements of Harmony. When equipped, it confers the bonus of each Mane Six plush, making it a very powerful item to have. Furthermore, it also adds a throwable Cadence weapon because why the heck not? :D

Colonists will equip plushies themselves, though you may need to force them to wear them on some occasions.

<b>BONUSES GIVEN</b>

Applejack: +10% to plant work speed and harvest yield.
Fluttershy: +10% to animal tame chance and training chance.
Pinkie Pie: +20% to social impact.
Rainbow Dash: +10% to movement and +5% to melee hit chance and shooting accuracy.
Rarity: +20% to trade price improvement.
Twilight Sparkle: +20% research speed.
Princess Cadence: +20% to pain shock threshold.
Princess Celestia: -20% to mental break threshold.
Princess Luna: +50% to rest multiplier (for faster sleep).
Big Macintosh: +25kg to maximum carry capacity.
Starlight Glimmer: -50% to psychic sensitivity.
Nurse Haywick (my OC): +20% to medical tend speed.

The throwable Cadence has the same stats as a pila, though it can be thrown a bit quicker; it requires skill 3 Crafting, a Cadence plush and 100 wood to make.
