* Royalty: Added an alert to show you when you have anti-bronies with harmony chips installed.
* Ideology: Added Flim and Flam (+25% conversion power).
	* Like the Aloe and Lotus plush, they require 1.5 times the materials of a regular plushie to make.
* Biotech: Added a new floordrawing, created by me. Finally, my laughable art skills can be put to good use!
* Biotech: Added the 'Shrewd Negotiator' ability, available to pawns with the Alicorn gene.
	* When used, it will vastly improve a pawn's negotiation ability, trade price improvement and social impact for 15 seconds.
	* If Ideology is enabled, it will also increase their conversion power.
	* For a pawn with level 20 Social and no other abilities or implants, using Shrewd Negotiator will grant 1900% negotiation ability, 300% trade price improvement, 1370% social impact and 2050% conversion power.

* Combat Extended: Added patch for Flim and Flam.
* Combat Extended: Added compatibility patches for the Sweetie Bot mechanoid.

* Core: Weapon sounds now work again. Many thanks to OttersHoldHands from the RimWorld Discord for fixing this issue.
* Core: Replaced the Fluttershy plushie in the Brony Community scenario with Maud Pie. After all, surely mining for steel and components at the start of a new game is slightly more important than trying to tame animals?
* Core: Mousing over the 'Anti brony has plushie' alert now properly shows the explanation.
* Core: NPC faction slave traders should now have slaves to sell.
* Combat Extended: Fixed 'Verse.PatchOperationAdd(xpath="/Defs/ThingDef[defName="*"]/statBases"): Failed to find a node with the given xpath` errors. As a result, all plushies now have a bulk of one and a worn bulk of... well, one.

* XML Extensions: Simplified the operation to change the cost of plushies which feature two ponies (Aloe and Lotus/Flim and Flam). You might be left with some unused variables, but you can safely delete them from the XML Extensions settings menu.

Version 3.30.19 (November 28th 2022)

* Core: Added the magic mirror (from Equestria Girls) as a building capable of generating power.
	* Generates 15000W of power.
	* Research level is Ultra with a base cost of 30000.
	* Research requires a hi-tech research bench and multi-analyser.
	* Building one requires 16 Construction, 75 components, 25 advanced components, 1000 each of plasteel, steel and uranium, and a Sunset Shimmer plushie. Note that the plushie cannot be manufactured; it can only be acquired from quests or exotic goods vendors.
	* If you stick a bunch of them in the same place you create a portal room, though nothing comes of it. (Thanks to Aelanna from the RimWorld Discord server for helping me with the C# I needed to make this work.)
* Core: Added Sunset Shimmer plushie. Since she can't be equipped, she can be found under the 'Manufactured' category.
* Core: Added 'PonyPlushie' apparel tag, meaning you can now create your own pawns that spawn with plushies should you so wish.
	* Thanks to bblkepling for the suggestion.
* Biotech: Added ability to create Sweetie Bot mechanoids.
	* Require high mechtech to unlock.
	* Created at a large gestator after two cycles.
	* Move very fast and are equipped with a rainbow laser, but are vulnerable to melee attacks.
	* Require 200 steel, 75 plasteel, a high subcore, 5 components and 5 bandwidth.

* Vanilla Achievements Expanded: Added achievement to acquire a Sunset Shimmer plush.
* Vanilla Achievements Expanded: Added achievement to build the magic mirror.
* Core: Fixed 'Config error in Brony_Mercenary_Grenadier: required apparel can't be worn together (Apparel_FlakPants, Apparel_Pants)' error.

* Core: Added a file containing 200 random words to use for NPC faction pawn names, though you may see some weird combinations as a result.
* Core: The NPC faction now employs mercenary grenadiers.
* Ideology: Added NPC faction mining, hunting, logging and farming camps.
* Biotech: Added child-equippable Rainbow Dash plushie (+2 to movement speed).
* Biotech: Added child-equippable Starlight Glimmer plushie.
* Biotech: Added the ability to request 5 hemogen packs from Nightmare Moon.
	* She demands 1000 silver for this service, meaning you are effectively paying 40 times the market value (since 5 hemogen packs have a total market value of 25). As such, making this request should always be considered a last resort.
	* This recipe is available as soon as you construct the statue.
* Biotech: Added six new recipes to the Nightmare Moon statue which let your mechanitors request things. Please note that, instead of signal, powerfocus or nanostructuring chips, she will demand 1.5 times the chips value in silver AND chocolate; you will also have to provide the regular/advanced components that you would normally use to create the item. This makes the items quite expensive to acquire, but is useful if you want some upgrades but lack the firepower and/or numbers to take down one of the mechanoid bosses.
	* Control sublink (standard)
	* Control sublink (high)
	* Remote repairer
	* Mech gestation processor
	* Remote shielder
	* Repair probe
	* These recipes can only be performed by a mechanitor, and are unlocked once you have researched the relevant technologies.
* Biotech: Added a recipe to the Nightmare Moon statue which lets you request a high subcore. Doing so requires 2250 silver, 750 chocolate and 25 hemogen packs, but you won't be forced to sacrifice a pawn or prisoner, thus avoiding the associated mood debuffs.
* Biotech: The NPC faction has welcomed various xenotypes into the fold. They are now 70% baseliner and 5% each of dirtmoles, pigskins, imps, yttakin, genies and neanderthals. Hussars, meanwhile, still only have a chance of appearing as elite mercenaries, while highmates, sanguophages and wasters will not appear at all (the latter two refused to partake in all of the fun and magic, the miserable gits).
* Combat Extended: Added bulk and worn bulk for child-equippable plushies.
* Replimat: Added a recipe to the Nightmare Moon statue which lets you request an isolinear module in exchange for 9000 chocolate (thus making it cost about 27000 silver compared to 18000 normally). The recipe will become available once you have researched molecular nutrient resequencing.
* Simple Sidearms: Added weapon tag maps for the wife thrower and rainbow laser.
* Vanilla Backgrounds Expanded: Added one new (very basic) background.
* XML Extensions: Added option to allow the child-equippable Rainbow Dash plushie to give the same bonuses as the adult version.

* Core: Melee brony mercenaries will now spawn with the 'Brawler' trait.
* Core: Changed the description of the NPC faction.
* Core: Nightmare Moon now demands both 125 chocolate and 10 industrial medicine before she will give you any glitterworld medicine.
* Core: Removed disallowed traits from the starting pawns in the brony community scenario. They can now be wimps, pyromaniacs or have chemical needs.
* Royalty: Updated 'request detoxifier stomach' recipe to reflect the fact it is now called a 'sterilising stomach.'
* Royalty: Fixed the Harmony chip not increasing bandwidth.
* Royalty: Fixed recipe to request a reprocessor stomach using the wrong item name in the bill list.
* Ideology: The patch which applies plushie bonuses to the harmony chip now checks to see if Royalty is enabled first.
* Biotech: Fixed plushie trader not stocking child-equippable plushies.
* Biotech: Fixed missing space in label for Button Mash plushie.
* RimPonk: Removed patches which add pawns from this mod to the NPC faction.

Version 3.0.0 (October 27th 2022)

* Biotech: Added four new genes.
	* Earth Pony: +25kg to carrying capacity.
	* Unicorn: +25% to manipulation.
	* Pegasus: +10% each to melee and trap dodge chance.
	* Alicorn: All of the above.
* Biotech: NPC faction elite brony mercenaries now have a 25% chance of being hussars.

	* Big Macintosh (+50kg to carrying capacity)

* Biotech: Added Button Mash (+2 bandwidth).
* Biotech: Added a patch which gives you a Button Mash plushie when starting the mechanitor scenario.
* Core: Added a recipe to the Daybreaker statue which lets you make 250 bottles of beer using 250 wort. You will need to use 75 chemfuel, and unlock the recipe with some additional research, but it's still a lot quicker than using the fermenting barrel!
* Core: Added patches for RimWorld 1.4 which allow you to change the colour of the regular Discord lamp. If you have the Ideology DLC, you will also be able to turn it into a darklight. The R/G/B and separate darklight versions still exist, as removing them causes errors, but the colour can't be changed.
* Core: An alert is now shown on the right of the screen when pawns with the anti brony trait have a plushie equipped.
* MedPod: Added a recipe to request isolinear processors from the Nightmare Moon statue. Each processor costs 3000 chocolate (thus making them cost 9000 silver) and can only be requested once you have researched accelerated cellular regeneration.
* MedPod: Added a patch which adds one isolinear processor to the stock carried by NPC faction exotic goods traders.
* Vanilla Achievements Expanded: Added an achievement for crafting the Button Mash plushie.
* Core: The poison joke addiction cure kit should now be working again.
* Core: Sweetie Bot turrets have undergone a few more upgrades, chief among them being the fact they no longer require rearming.
	* To compensate for this, the power consumption has been increased to 350W (was 175).
	* Furthermore, the construction cost has increased to to 600 stuff, 5 advanced components and 250 plasteel.
	* You can now build Sweetie Bots out of metals such as steel and uranium.
	* Lowered required construction skill to 12 (was 15).
	* Increased mass to 35 (was 8).
	* Combat Extended users are unaffected by these changes, and will still need to provide ammo as normal.
* Vanilla Achievements Expanded: Changed the criteria for earning the 'Friendship is Magic' achievement, as it wasn't tracking your psycasts properly. Instead, you now have to buy or sell 100 Elements of Harmony (not all at once, thankfully).
* Weeb Faction: The Weeaboo Army and the NPC brony faction have had a bit of a falling out, and are once again hostile towards each other. Despite this, player-led brony communities seem to be unaffected, and can still freely interact with their anime loving friends.
	* Only applies to new colonies; existing ones may still see the two as being friendly with each other.
* XML Extensions: Removed setting related to rearming Sweetie Bot turrets. This will leave you with an unused setting, which can be safely deleted.
* XML Extensions: The crafting skill you set for crafting regular plushies will be applied to the child versions as well.
* XML Extensions: The market value you set for regular plushies will be divided by two and applied to the child versions.

* Core: Added Fleur de Lis (+2 to pawn beauty).
	* This bonus is not applied to the harmony chip.
* Core: Added five new recipes to the Daybreaker statue that let you convert materials into 1000 silver. Handy if you've got an excess of one thing and would like to convert it into another.
	* Materials required are exactly the same as you get when converting from silver, such as 526 steel or 111 plasteel.

Version 2.81.138 (October 5th 2022)

* Core: The poison joke addiction cure wasn't showing up in a pawn's health bills, so I've changed how it works.
	* Added a new item, made at a drug lab using 10 neutroamine and 15 herbal medicine, which will cure the poison joke addiction when it is ingested.
	* Requires 6 Medical skill to make.
	* Researching the cure is still required.
	* Works instantly with no adverse side effects.

* Humanoid Alien Races: The brony trait now conflicts with the xenophobia trait.
	* I'm not sure if it is possible to allow bronies to be xenophiles and not xenophobes; for now, they can't be either.

Version 2.53.102 (September 9th 2022)

* Core: Added Spoiled Rich (-25% to toxic sensitivity).

	* These changes have been made because it was too easy to build a lot of these turrets and not worry about raiders, as they'd be too busy hitting them to pay any attention to your colonists.
* Core: Fixed '... does not belong in <ThingDef> (defName="MLRP_ElementsOfHarmony")' error.
* Core: Fixed '... does not belong in <ThingDef> (defName="PonyPlush_CutieMarkCrusaders")' error.

* Core: Added a patch, applied if Single Use Grenades N'at is enabled, that reduces the cost of making wife throwers to just 10 wood. It makes sense to do this because, well, 75 wood to make something that you only get to throw once is kinda expensive.
* Core: You should now be able to make Rainbow Lasers using Elements of Harmony again. This seems kinda tempermental, so I'd like to apologise in advance if it turns out not to work.

* NPC faction settlements will now have a maximum of 2 techprints in stock at any one time.

* Added the ability to build Sweetie Bot turrets using any kind of textile.

	* They now require being loaded with wooden bullets, made at a plushie bench.
	* Each turret has a magazine size of 5000, with a one second reload time.
	* Making ammo requires 100 wood, and makes 5000 rounds at a time.
	* I haven't actually tested these patches, so PLEASE tell me if they break!

	* Quick research is exactly that, and can be done at a simple research bench. (Base cost: 500)

* Speaking of the Rainbow Laser, I've altered the parts of it that pawns can use in melee. It now has a barrel for poking people with, and a butt for smacking people with.
* Combat Extended: Increased aiming accuracy of Sweetie Bot turrets to 45% (was 25%).
* Combat Extended: Fixed error with Sweetie Bot patches.
* Updated preview image (again).

* Core: Added poison joke.

Version 2.3.8 (April 24th 2022)

* With 26 plushies added by this mod(1), there is a lot of choice involved; do you equip a Rainbow Dash to help with combat, or an Applejack to help with the harvest? Well, as long as you have the Royalty DLC, you no longer need to faff about with such inane decisions, thanks to... the Harmony Chip!
	* When implanted into the brain, this marvellous piece of tech will grant the bonuses of every plushie at once (except for Starlight, because -100% psychic sensitivity isn't much use to a psycaster).
	* Costs 350 each of steel, plasteel and uranium, 175 gold and 10 advanced components to make at a plushie bench.
	* Requires research at a hi-tech research bench with multi-analyser.

	* Users of XML Extensions should be able to install it in any modded humanlike thanks to a patch.
	* You can still equip plushies if you have a chip installed.

	* Slave suppression is also included, meaning you can put this in your slaves to improve their work. Ironic, I know.
* Vanilla Achievements Expanded: Added an achievement to install a harmony chip in a pawn.
* (Royalty) Added a patch which turns the anima tree into the Tree of Harmony.
	* It only changes the name, description and texture.
	* Doesn't change anima grass.
	* May look a bit weird depending on whether other trees were near it.
* Updated preview image.
* Fixed incorrect description (it still had links to the old expansions and the CE patch).
* Recipes to recycle the Elements of Harmony and Cutie Mark Crusaders no longer assume you want to recycle every one that you get; you can now specify how much durability they need to have before they are recycled. (You may need to check the bills and ensure that the item has a green tick next to it.)
* Anti-bronies now have a -25 opinion of bronies (was -50).
* Fixed Zephyr Breeze not increasing home area when constructed.
* Fixed Zephyr Breeze not having 1000 maximum health as specified in earlier patch notes.

	* Each recipe requires the same items as it normally would, as well as the 75 chemfuel required by other Daybreaker bills. As a bonus, however, the process is significantly faster than using the fabrication bench; this allows you to save a lot of time when creating components.

* Added a patch, applied if Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Production is enabled, which allows the plushie bench to benefit from being near tailor cabinets.

Version 1.123.232 (March 25th 2022)

* Removed support for version 1.0 of RimWorld.
	* A version of this mod which is compatible with it can be found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2783974303
	* Please note that many things will have been changed or removed in order to make it compatible.
* Daybreaker wasn't working as a moisture pump, so she has undergone a massive transformation.
	* She is now a statue, like Nightmare Moon; the building materials are the same, except you use a Celestia plush instead of a Luna plush.
	* She will allow you to convert 100 of either jade, steel, plasteel, uranium or gold into whatever the equivalent market value is of another.
		* Example #1: Convert steel into uranium. Steel has a market value of 1.9, and uranium has a market value of 6. 100 steel has a total market value of $190; dividing this by 6 means you will get 32 (rounded up) uranium for your 100 steel.
		* Example #2: Convert 100 gold into jade. Gold has a market value of 10, and jade has a market value of 5. 100 gold has a total market value of $1000; dividing this by 5 means you will get 200 jade for your 100 gold.
	* She will now emit the same amount of heat as a wood-fired generator, as well as give off a glow.
	* Converting materials will also require 75 chemfuel.
	* Pawns only need to be assigned to Basic work in order to use this building.
	* The building is now referred to as 'Statue of Daybreaker' instead of just 'Daybreaker.'
	* The building is a bit bigger now, at 2x2 instead of 1x1; if you had Daybreaker installed in a place where this new size would cause issues, you will find that she has been automatically uninstalled (and damaged) when you load your game.
	* Please note that you will get red errors when trying to interact with the building after reinstalling it, but I've been told those are only a one-time thing and should go away once you save and reload. However, if they do persist for some reason, you can just destroy the old ones.
* New recipes added to the Nightmare Moon statue.
	* Request an elephant tusk for 40 chocolate. ((80 / 3) * 1.5) = 40 (for a total silver cost of 120)
	* Return an elephant tusk for 3 chocolate. ((80/10) / 3 = 3 chocolate)
* Made changes to the research for Nightmare Moon.
	* It is now called 'Evil Sisters' and unlocks the ability to build both statues.
	* Increased research cost to 7500 (was 5000).
	* The defName has not been changed; if you already had the old tech researched, the game will ask you to complete the extra 2500 points of research that was added. Any techprints you had applied should still be available.
* Fixed being unable to uninstall and reinstall statues of Daybreaker.
* Fixed being unable to uninstall and reinstall statues of Nightmare Moon.
* Fixed being unable to uninstall and reinstall plushie benches.
* Vanilla Achievements Expanded: The achievement to build Daybreaker is now worth 50 points (was 25).
* Vanilla Achievements Expanded: Renamed the achievement to craft a rainbow laser to Emphasis On 'Harm.'
* RimPonk Unique Pawns: Fixed NPC Faction not starting as allied if you start a new colony with Celestia in it.

	* Requires 10 Crafting to make using 1 plush Element, 100 plasteel, 3 advanced components and 50 gold.
	* Must research 'Rainbow Laser' first, which itself requires precision rifling, a techprint (obtainable from imperial and outlander factions), a hi-tech research bench and a multi-analyser.

		* AUTHOR'S NOTE: Since your starting pawns are all pacifists, it only seems fair to give them armour.
