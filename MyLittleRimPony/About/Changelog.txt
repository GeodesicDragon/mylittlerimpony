	* I haven't actually tested these patches, so PLEASE tell me if they break!
* Overhauled research system to use tiers of Quick, Easy, Medium, Hard, and Very Hard.
	* Quick research is exactly that, and can be done at a simple research base. (Base cost: 500)

* Speaking of the Rainbow Laser, I've altered the parts of it that pawns can use in melee. It now has a barrel for poking people with, and a butt for smacking people with.

Version 2.3.8 (April 24th 2022)

* With 26 plushies added by this mod(1), there is a lot of choice involved; do you equip a Rainbow Dash to help with combat, or an Applejack to help with the harvest? Well, as long as you have the Royalty DLC, you no longer need to faff about with such inane decisions, thanks to... the Harmony Chip!
	* When implanted into the brain, this marvellous piece of tech will grant the bonuses of every plushie at once (except for Starlight, because -100% psychic sensitivity isn't much use to a psycaster).
	* Costs 350 each of steel, plasteel and uranium, 175 gold and 10 advanced components to make at a plushie bench.
	* Requires research at a hi-tech research bench with multi-analyser.

	* Users of XML Extensions should be able to install it in any modded humanlike thanks to a patch.
	* You can still equip plushies if you have a chip installed.
	* Starlight isn't included in the bonuses because -100% to psychic sensitivity is of no use to psycasters.
	* Slave suppression is also included, meaning you can put this in your slaves to improve their work. Ironic, I know.
* Vanilla Achievements Expanded: Added an achievement to install a harmony chip in a pawn.
* (Royalty) Added a patch which turns the anima tree into the Tree of Harmony.
	* It only changes the name, description and texture.
	* Doesn't change anima grass.
	* May look a bit weird depending on whether other trees were near it.
* Updated preview image.
* Fixed incorrect description (it still had links to the old expansions and the CE patch).
* Recipes to recycle the Elements of Harmony and Cutie Mark Crusaders no longer assume you want to recycle every one that you get; you can now specify how much durability they need to have before they are recycled. (You may need to check the bills and ensure that the item has a green tick next to it.)
* Anti-bronies now have a -25 opinion of bronies (was -50).
* Fixed Zephyr Breeze not increasing home area when constructed.
* Fixed Zephyr Breeze not having 1000 maximum health as specified in earlier patch notes.
* Sweetie Bot is reporting a 12.5% decrease in power usage with zero loss in efficiency (175W, down from 200W).
* Fixed Sweetie Bot turrets exploding even though it says in the description that they don't.

	* Each recipe requires the same items as it normally would, as well as the 75 chemfuel required by other Daybreaker bills. As a bonus, however, the process is significantly faster than using the fabrication bench; this allows you to save a lot of time when creating components.
	* These recipes will only appear once you have researched the relevant manufacturing technologies.
* Added a patch, applied if Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Production is enabled, which allows the plushie bench to benefit from being near tailor cabinets.

Version 1.123.232 (March 25th 2022)

* Removed support for version 1.0 of RimWorld.
	* A version of this mod which is compatible with it can be found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2783974303
	* Please note that many things will have been changed or removed in order to make it compatible.
* Daybreaker wasn't working as a moisture pump, so she has undergone a massive transformation.
	* She is now a statue, like Nightmare Moon; the building materials are the same, except you use a Celestia plush instead of a Luna plush.
	* She will allow you to convert 100 of either jade, steel, plasteel, uranium or gold into whatever the equivalent market value is of another.
		* Example #1: Convert steel into uranium. Steel has a market value of 1.9, and uranium has a market value of 6. 100 steel has a total market value of $190; dividing this by 6 means you will get 32 (rounded up) uranium for your 100 steel.
		* Example #2: Convert 100 gold into jade. Gold has a market value of 10, and jade has a market value of 5. 100 gold has a total market value of $1000; dividing this by 5 means you will get 200 jade for your 100 gold.
	* She will now emit the same amount of heat as a wood-fired generator, as well as give off a glow.
	* Converting materials will also require 75 chemfuel.
	* Pawns only need to be assigned to Basic work in order to use this building.
	* The building is now referred to as 'Statue of Daybreaker' instead of just 'Daybreaker.'
	* The building is a bit bigger now, at 2x2 instead of 1x1; if you had Daybreaker installed in a place where this new size would cause issues, you will find that she has been automatically uninstalled (and damaged) when you load your game.
	* Please note that you will get red errors when trying to interact with the building after reinstalling it, but I've been told those are only a one-time thing and should go away once you save and reload. However, if they do persist for some reason, you can just destroy the old ones.
* New recipes added to the Nightmare Moon statue.
	* Request an elephant tusk for 40 chocolate. ((80 / 3) * 1.5) = 40 (for a total silver cost of 120)
	* Return an elephant tusk for 3 chocolate. ((80/10) / 3 = 3 chocolate)
* Made changes to the research for Nightmare Moon.
	* It is now called 'Evil Sisters' and unlocks the ability to build both statues.
	* Increased research cost to 7500 (was 5000).
	* The defName has not been changed; if you already had the old tech researched, the game will ask you to complete the extra 2500 points of research that was added. Any techprints you had applied should still be available.
* Fixed being unable to uninstall and reinstall statues of Daybreaker.
* Fixed being unable to uninstall and reinstall statues of Nightmare Moon.
* Fixed being unable to uninstall and reinstall plushie benches.
* Vanilla Achievements Expanded: The achievement to build Daybreaker is now worth 50 points (was 25).
* Vanilla Achievements Expanded: Renamed the achievement to craft a rainbow laser to Emphasis On 'Harm.'
* RimPonk Unique Pawns: Fixed NPC Faction not starting as allied if you start a new colony with Celestia in it.

Version 1.120.223 (March 20th 2022)

		* Healer Mech Serum: ((1300/10) / 3 = 43 chocolate)
		* Resurrector Mech Serum: ((1700/10) / 3 = 57 chocolate)
		* Techprof Subpersona Core: ((1000/10) / 3 = 33 chocolate)
		* Thrumbo Horn: ((800/10) / 3 = 27 chocolate)
	* Added the ability to build statues using metallic stuff.
	* The building is now referred to as 'Statue of Nightmare Moon' instead of just 'Nightmare Moon.'

Version 1.112.213 (March 17th 2022)

* Added Daybreaker (building).
	* She's basically a moisture pump that runs on chemfuel, thus eliminating the need to build power conduits all over the place.
	* Requires a Celestia plush, 75 chemfuel, 4 components and 30 steel to construct.
	* Unlocked when you research the standard moisture pump.
* Added Nightmare Moon (building).
	* Provides exotic items - persona cores, healer/resurrector mech serums, techprof cores and thrumbo horns - in exchange for chocolate.
	* Requires 12 Construction skill, 500 stone blocks, a Luna plushie, 10 advanced components, 150 steel and 100 gold to construct.
	* Can only be built on terrain which supports heavy structures.
	* Pawns only need to be assigned to Basic work in order to use this building.
	* The amount of chocolate required is worked out by taking the market value of the item you want, dividing it by the market value of chocolate (three silver), and then multiplying that figure by 1.5; if you then multiply the result by 3, it works out at a 50% increase in the price.
		* AI Persona Core: ((4000 / 3) * 1.5) = 1999.5 (rounded to 2000, for a total silver cost of 6000)
		* Healer Mech Serum: ((1300 / 3) * 1.5) = 649.5 (rounded to 650, for a total silver cost of 1950)
		* Resurrector Mech Serum: ((1700 / 3) * 1.5) = 850.5 (rounded to 850, for a total silver cost of 2550)
